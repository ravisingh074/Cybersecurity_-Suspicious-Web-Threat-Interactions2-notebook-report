# Cybersecurity – Suspicious Web Threat Interactions

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing suspicious web threat interaction data to identify abnormal behavior and potential security risks. The goal of the analysis is to detect patterns that may indicate malicious or unusual network activity.

The project was implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook, combining data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains records of web interactions and network-related attributes that may represent suspicious activities. Data preprocessing steps were performed to clean, structure, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

---

## Objectives

* Analyze patterns in web threat interactions
* Identify abnormal or suspicious behavior
* Visualize network activity trends
* Apply machine learning for detection

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning

---

## Methodology

The analysis followed a structured workflow:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning & preprocessing
3. Feature analysis
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data visualization
6. Machine learning implementation
7. Insight generation

---

## Key Observations

* Certain interactions show unusual behavior patterns
* Variations in activity may indicate anomalies
* Machine learning techniques help identify suspicious records

Detailed findings are available in the notebook.
